//! Server that uses a thread pool to execute the methods
/*!
 *  The thread-pool server creates a set of worker thread that are used to execute
 *  the methods that are called.  The main thread uses a select call to receive
 *  from all of the connections similar to ServerST but does not execute the method.
 *  The connection is then placed in a queue for the thread pool to perform the
 *  execution.  The worker can write the result and may continue with another message
 *  if it is already in the buffer.
 *
 *  The number of threads for the worker pool is separately defined from the maximum
 *  number of simultaneous connections.
 *
 *  The current implementation uses a UDP socket on the same port as the main server
 *  so that the worker thread can signal to the main thread that it is finished.
 *  This allows the server to add this thread to the select call.
 *  Under Linux this could be implemented with a signal and the pselect function,
 *  but this is not portable to Windows.
 *
 *  ServerTP should only be called by starting a thread and not by a direct call
 *  to Work although this is not prevented in the current implementation.
